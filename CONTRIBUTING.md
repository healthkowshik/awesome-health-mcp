# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Awesome Health MCP.

## What belongs in this list

Entries must be related to both:

- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Health, healthcare, life sciences, biomedical, or clinical domains

## Contribution rules

Follow these rules before opening a PR:

- Use at most 5 sections in `README.md`.
- Keep section order stable and logical (broad categories before specialized ones).
- Sort entries alphabetically by `owner/repo` inside each section.
- Use this exact entry format:

```markdown
- **[owner/repo](https://github.com/owner/repo)** — one-line description.
```

- Add only valid repository URLs (no 404 pages).
- Do not add repos that appear inactive for more than 12 months.
- Do not add duplicates (same `owner/repo` or same URL).
- Do not add list-of-lists entries (for example, large aggregator lists).

## How to add a new entry

1. Find a candidate repository relevant to MCP and health.
2. Verify the GitHub repository URL is valid.
3. Verify the repository appears active within the last 12 months.
4. Check `README.md` to ensure the repo is not already listed.
5. Pick the best-fit existing section.
6. Insert the entry in alphabetical order by `owner/repo`.
7. Keep the description concise and factual.
