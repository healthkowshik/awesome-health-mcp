## Guidelines

Follow the below guidelines while planning, doing research as well as contributing to this repository.

### Minimum acceptance criteria

- This project is to curate a list of awesome Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for health.
- Minimum acceptance criteria for an item to be listed is that it should be related to both Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Health.

### Listing format

- Recommended format with an example is below for reference.

```markdown
- **[anthropics/healthcare](https://github.com/anthropics/healthcare)** — MCP marketplace of healthcare skills and plugins for Claude (FHIR, clinical workflows, PubMed, CMS, NPI).
```

### Valid URLs only

- Before including a URL, check if the link exists and the page is legit.
- Ex: https://github.com/anthropics/healthcare is a good example for an item on the README since the URL is of a valid repository.
- Ex: But, https://github.com/Kartha-AI/agentcare-mcp is not since it opens up Github's 404 page.

### No duplicates please

- Do not include if it's already in the list, no duplicates please.
- Before including something, do a through scan of the README to check if the new to be added link already exists on the README.

### Avoid listing lists

- Pages like https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers are lists themselves. Avoid listing such pages which are large lists themselves.
- The idea with this project, awesome health MCP is to list down individual items, not link to other lists.
